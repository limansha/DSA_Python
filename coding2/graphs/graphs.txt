graph representation :
The adjacency list is generally more memory-efficient for sparse graphs, while the adjacency matrix is more efficient for dense graphs.

dfs and bfs helps us to find ans to the below questns
is node exist or not?
is path exisits between two node?
how many paths are possible from source node to dest node?
